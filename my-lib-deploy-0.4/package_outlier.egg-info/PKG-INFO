Description: # Outlier detection package
        A Python based outlier detection package.
        
        # Outlier detection by zscore
        Zscore is a common method to detect anomaly in 1-D.
        For a given data point zscore is calculated by:\
        zscore = data_point - mean / std_dev
        
        The function take data and threshold value as required argument and returns data points that are outliers.
        
        # Outlier detection by modified_zscore
        Mean and standard deviation are themselves prone to outliers that's why we use median instead of mean and median absolute deviation instead of mean absolute deviation.\
        For more info on median absolute deviation refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation.
        
        # Parameters for package_outlier.zscore_and_anomaly_detection()
        data : array like\
        An array like object containing the sample data
        
        threshold : int
        
        flag : int, optional\
        Default is 1. 1 for data points greater than threshold value and 0 for data points lesser than threshold value\
        
        ddof: int, optional\
        Degrees of freedom correction in the calculation of the standard deviation. Default is 0.
        
        nan_policy: {"propagate", "raise", "omit"}, optional\
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan. "propagate" returns nan, "raise" throws an error, "omit" performs the calculations ignoring nan values. Default is "propagate".
        
        Returns:\
        zscore: array_like
        The z-scores, standardized by mean and standard deviation of input array.
        outliers: array_like
        These are points from data that are outliers.
        
        # Parameters for package_outlier.modified_zscore_and_anomaly_detection()
        data : array like\
        An array like object containing the sample data
        
        threshold : int
        
        flag : int, optional\
        Default is 1. 1 for data points greater than threshold value and 0 for data points lesser than threshold value
        
        consistency_correction: float, optional\
        Default is 1.4826. converts MAD to the standard deviation for a given distribution.
        
        Returns:\
        modified_zscore: array_like\
        The modified-z-scores of input array.
        
        mad: float\
        median_absolute_deviation
        
        outliers: array_like\
        These are points from data that are outliers.
        
        ```
        import package_outlier
        import numpy as np
        
        arr = [8,5,7,8,11,13,4,9,10,7,6]
        arr = np.array(arr)
        
        zscore, outliers = package_outlier.zscore_and_anomaly_detection(arr, 1)
        print(zscore)
        print(outliers)
        
        
        modified_zscore, mad, outliers = package_outlier.modified_zscore_and_anomaly_detection(arr, 1)
        print(modified_zscore)
        print(mad)
        print(outliers)
        
        ```
